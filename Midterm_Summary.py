# Session 1 & 2

#  IDE --> Integrated Development Environment
# Popular IDEs: Eclipse, Atom, Pycharm , Visual Studio

# Source Control: term used to describe a system that allows the tracking
# and managing of changes to code.

# Session 3 & 4

# Definitions are either ways to assign names to values or
# creating new "procedures" that we want to use as primitives

# Commands are statements that instruct the interpreter to do something.

# All objects have an identity, type and value.
# Identity - never changes for an object.
# Type - determines the operations it can support and define the possible values it can have. We can use the function type() to get the type of an object.
# Value - Objects whose value change are called "mutable", while objects whose value cannot change after being created are called "inmutable"

# Basic Scalar Objects:
# int - basic integer numbers: 5, 0, -6
# float - real numbers: 2.3, 0.4, -5.0
# bool - Boolean value: True or False
# NoneType - special type, has only one value: None

# TRY/EXCEPT SYNTAX AND FUNCTIONALITY

try:
    num = input("Give me a number")
    num = int(num)
    num2 = input("Give me another number")
    num2 = int(num2)
    result = num / num2

except ValueError:
    print("Please give me a proper number")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("The second number can not be zero")
except:
    print("Some other exception I did not see coming")
else:
    print("The division result is", result)


# IF STATEMENT

# If the logical condition is true, then the indented statement gets executed.
# If the logical condition is false, the indented statement gets skipped.
# Si no sabes como empezar con el if statement, basicamente usa if True: y seguis con el indented block q es lo de else y elif.

if number % 2 == 0:
    print(number, "is an even number")
    print(“Nothing would be printed if it were odd”)

# In this if statement, there's two options.
    # Only one of them gets executed based on the condition evaluated.
# If the condition is true, then the indented statement gets executed.
#If the condition is false, the indented statement after else gets executed.

if number % 2==0:
    print(number, "is an even number")
else
    print(number, "is an odd number")

# Sometimes there's more than 2 possibilities:

if a > b:
    print(a, ">", b)
elif a < b:
    print(a, "<", b)
else:
    print(a, "=", b)


# WHILE STATEMENTS
# similar to the if statement.

    while True:
        num = input("Give me a number (type quit to exit)")
        num2 = input("Give me another number(type quit to exit)")
        if num == "quit" or num2 == "quit":
            break
        num = int(num)
        num2 = int(num2)
        if num2 == 0:
            print("Can not divide by zero")
            continue
        print("The division result of", num, "and", num2, "is", num / num2)

# STRING OPERATIONS
# The len() function will return the length of a string.

salute = "hey there!"
    len(salute)

# FILES

# to open a file we use open()
#first parameter is the filename (path included), second parameter is the mode.
# The modes are: r (read), w (write), x (exclusive creation), a (append), b (binary), t (text), + (update).

fp = open("text.txt", "r")
print(fp)
all = fp.read()
print(all)
fp.close()

<_io.TextIOWrapper name='text.txt' mode='r' encoding='cp1252'>
#This is a file I wrote
#I made it quite short
#There are only 3 lines


# Once the file is open we use write().
fp = open("text.txt", "a")
print(fp)
line = input("Give me some text, don't be shy: ")
fp.write(line)
fp.write("\n")
fp.close()
#this program will keep appending to the file

# we can simplify the process using the with statement
with open("text.txt", "a") as fp:
    print(fp)
    line = input("Give me some text, don't be shy: ")
    fp.write(line)
    fp.write("\n")
